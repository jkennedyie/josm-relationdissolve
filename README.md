# RelationDissolve JOSM Plugin

RelationDissolve is an OpenStreetMap JOSM Editor Plugin designed to simplify creating a new relation based on multiple existing relations.

It provides one new context-menu option for the JOSM Relations Window (Alt+Shift+R): Select dissolved members.

When multiple relations are selected in the JOSM Relations Window, this new menu option dissolves then selects the members of these relations for immediate load into the Create A New Relation dialog box.

The dissolve operation only selects the very outer (and very inner, if appropriate) members of the relations selected: borders between the selected relations are ignored.
